So, it is ease of use: </br>




  * simple interface view represnting rooms + using friendly symbols and icon.  
  * easy enter & modify room's alert time.
  * easily show All times allocated to rooms (in general) & allocated time for each room separately (in particular).
  * using real time (RTC).

  * there is plastic separators in each room for easy picking different medicine and separate between them.
