# What's special about it?
we try to eliminate some constraints and limits that make it quiete hard to use. </br>
So, it is ease of use: </br>




  * simple interface view represnting rooms + using friendly symbols and icon.  
  * easy enter & modify room's alert time.
  * easily show All times allocated to rooms (in general) & allocated time for each room separately (in particular).
  * using real time (RTC).

  * using touch sensor instead of push button that is quiete harder for finger than touching.
  * ensure awareness of the patient by holding on touch sensor for 2 second to turn off the alert.
  * give flag light by LED to the room where you should take your medicine from.
  * there is plastic separators in each room for easy picking different medicine and separate between them.
